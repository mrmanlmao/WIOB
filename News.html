                            <p class="card-text">Greetings again from the darkness. Fairy Tales traditionally have happy endings so that our kids form an optimistic view of the world. Unfortunately, director John Ippolito brings us a real life baseball fairy tale with a tragic ending. Tony Conigliaro and his brothers Billy and Richie, grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts, just a few miles from historic Fenway Park, and two ended up wearing the Red Sox uniform – only it was Tony that was the legend … the can’t miss prospect who was presumed to be a future Hall-of-Famer...</p>

                            <h6 class="card-title">By Loren King | The Boston Globe</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">Two of Boston’s longest-running film festivals, the Boston Film Festival and the Roxbury International Film Festival, will present narrative features, documentaries, and shorts digitally this year, with nearly all screenings followed by virtual discussions with filmmakers.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">“It is critical to keep going. We want to support filmmakers who can’t get their films into theaters,” says Robin Dawson, BFF executive director.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">“The BFF launches its 36th season Sept. 24-27. Opening night offers socially distanced screenings at the Showplace Icon Theatre in the Seaport (theater tickets are $14.50), but all films and post-screening talks are available for virtual viewing. The festival kicks off Thursday at 7:30 p.m. with the US premiere of “Small Town Wisconsin,” about a fun-loving father (David Sullivan), who after losing custody of his 9-year-old son (Cooper J. Friedman) takes the boy for a last wild weekend in Milwaukee that does not go as expected. Director Niels Mueller and cast members will participate in a post-screening conversation.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Also screening Thursday, at 9 p.m., is the US premiere of “Paper Spiders,” a bittersweet coming-of-age story about a high school student (Stefania LaVie Owen) struggling to help her mother (Lili Taylor) whose paranoid delusions are starting to spiral out of control. Taylor joins writers Natalie Shampanier and Inon Shampanier (who also directed the film) for a post-screening discussion...</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Filmmaker Niels Mueller returns to 'Small Town Wisconsin'</h4>
                            <h6 class="card-title">By: Rob Thomas | The Capital Times</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">Before COVID-19, screenwriter and filmmaker Niels Mueller came home to Milwaukee every six weeks or so to visit his elderly parents. Mueller grew up in the city, where his father owned a furniture warehouse.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">But until recently, Mueller’s projects, including the 2004 film “The Assassination of Richard Nixon” starring Sean Penn and the CBS drama “The Defenders,” haven’t come back to the Badger State.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Mueller rectifies that in a big way with his latest film. “Small Town Wisconsin” is steeped in affection for Wisconsin, with cameos by Miller Park, Point Beer and indie filmmaker Mark Borchardt.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">“I've always had in the back of my head that I'd really like to film locally in Wisconsin,” Mueller said in a phone interview from his home in Los Angeles. “It presents challenges, because we don't have a tax credit anymore. And while there's good crew, there's not a lot of crew. And so part of me just really wanted to be a part of bringing more filmmaking to a place I love.”</p>
                            <p class="card-text">“Small Town Wisconsin” will have its U.S. premiere at the 36th Annual Boston Film Festival this Thursday. Because the festival is mostly virtual this year (although Mueller’s film will have an in-person premiere screening with COVID-related precautions), audiences in Wisconsin and everywhere else can watch the film online for $10 during the festival...</p>
